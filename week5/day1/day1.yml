 -> Give meaningful name for the method i.e 
 -> replace main with runCreateLead
Add @Test on top of the method import @Test from org.testng.annotations
Right click and run as 1 TestNG Test
Steps to do Sequential Execution:
Select the required testcases and click TestNG -> Convert to TestNG -> A testng.xml wizard will appear
If you want give suite name, test name and click finish
A testng.xml file will appear inside your project
Double click and open the xml file Note : By default Design tab will be selected -> Select the source tab in the bottom
Run the suite file as Run As -> TestNG Suite
testng.xml
Location -> path of testng.xml
-> Represents a test suite
Contains on eor more
- Represents a testcase / group of testcases -> contains one or more classes contains one or more REpresents the java classes which contains test method verbose - It is an attribute to get the failure logs in the console


<suite>

<test>

<classes>

 </classes>

<classes>
<class name=week5.day1.deletelead/>

</classes>



</test>

<test></test>

add  attribute name "verbose"

verbose default value=1
range between - 1 to 10
verbose=5


Annotations:

@Test -> Mandatory 

other annotations are optional
